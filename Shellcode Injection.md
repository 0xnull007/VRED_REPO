In von Neumann architecture, the code and data are stored in the same memory unit and processed by the same processor. This architecture was proposed by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann in 1945. It has been widely adopted since then, due to its simplicity and flexibility. The basic idea behind von Neumann architecture is that all instructions are stored as data and all data can be used as instructions. This allows for a much more efficient use of memory than storing code and data separately, as was done previously.

But it lead to many security issues. Since data and code are stored in same memory, hackers can use the data to be used as code. In other words they can send the carefully crafted data that can be directly executed by the processor. 

### How does it get Injected?
Usually, programmers make mistakes and we use that mistake to exploit the 

In this post, we'll learn how can we write carefully crafted input data that can execute directly and can gain access to different system resource.
