## Intro

Vulnerability research and exploit development are processes used by security professionals to identify and take advantage of weaknesses in computer systems and software. Vulnerability research involves identifying and analyzing potential security vulnerabilities in systems and software, while exploit development involves creating a program or script that can take advantage of a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control over a system. These processes are often used by white hat security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities to software vendors so that they can be patched, but they can also be used by black hat hackers to gain unauthorized access to systems
